# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

In my version, I created two classes, one to build the model (deeplearning.py), and another one to trigger inferences (deeplearninginfer.py)

usage: train.py [-h] [--gpu] [--save_dir SAVE_DIR] [--arch ARCH]
                [--learning_rate LEARNING_RATE] [--hidden_units HIDDEN_UNITS]
                [--epochs EPOCHS] [--version]
                data_directory
